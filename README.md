iOS task for Ephemeryde Technologies Recruitment


You will have to create an iOS app which can search, cache and display results from the below API.

The flow of the application should be like this:

1. The launch screen should have a list of breeds for the user to select from. You can be innovative in making the list searchable for better user experience.

2. Once the user selects a breed, the next view should display him an image of that breed and a list of sub-breeds for that breed which can again be selected to see details of the sub-breed.
3. Cache the image so that if the same breed is selected again the image can be shown from the cache itself.
4. The user should be able to go back to the listing page to change his selection.


Please note:

1. We would like to see clean views with special emphasis on user experience.
2. We want to see your coding style so please make sure that the code is well structured as per standard design patterns.
